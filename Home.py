         I would not include in my programmer's CV, as of now this blog includes my 2D and 3D design projects,
         some photographies I have done and a bit of my climbing journey.  
         I believe creativity and curiosity are fundamental tools for both personal enjoyment and 
         professional development, this is an attempt to show a bit of both.  
         None of the things I show here are big projects but rather the result of my self-taught journey into
         different disciplines.""")
